          By uploading your Contributions to the Application, you hereby
          authorize Company to grant to each end user a personal, limited,

          that Company may, without liability to you, access, use, preserve
          and/or disclose your account information and Contributions to law
          enforcement authorities, government officials, and/or a third party,
          as Company believes is reasonably necessary or appropriate, if legally
          required to do so or if we have a good faith belief that such access,
          use, disclosure, or preservation is reasonably necessary to: (a)
          comply with legal process or request; (b) enforce this Agreement,
          including investigation of any potential violation thereof; (c)

        <p>
          For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding
          paragraphs of this Section include, but are not limited to, the right
          to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of
          the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly
          perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the
          musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This
          means that you are granting us the right to use your Contribution
          without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including,
          but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record
          label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a
          performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a
          &ldquo;
          <strong>PRO</strong>&rdquo;), a sound recording PRO (e.g.,
          SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or
          other royalty participants involved in the creation of Contribution.

            Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists.
          </span>
          &nbsp; If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are
          affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the
          royalty-free license you grant through this Agreement in your
          Contribution to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your
          compliance with the relevant PRO&rsquo;s reporting obligations. If you
          have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain
          the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free
          license(s) set forth in this Agreement in your Contribution or have
          such music publisher enter into an agreement with us. Just because you
          authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have
          the right to grant us the licenses in this Agreement. If you are a
          recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are
          solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Company Services
          is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your
          record label, including if you create any new recordings through the
          Company Services that may be claimed by your label.

          any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or
          promotional materials related to such Contributions. You also waive
          any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a

          assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all
          moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on

              <strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong>
              This Agreement and all aspects of the Application and Company
              Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
              internal laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to
              conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims
              not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set
              forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in
              connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts
              located in Bergen County, State of New Jersey, and you hereby
              consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
              jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and
              jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
              United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
              of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Additionally,
              application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
              (UCITA) is excluded from this Agreement. In no event shall any
              claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the
              Application or Company Services be instituted more than two (2)
              years after the cause of action arose.&nbsp;

              <strong>Informal Resolution.</strong>
              To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
              controversy or claim related to this Agreement
              (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and Company agree to first attempt to
              negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided
              below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
              any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations
              commence upon written notice from one person to the other.
            </span>

            <span className="mr-5">c.</span>
            <span>
              <strong>Binding Arbitration Agreement</strong>. If you and Company
              are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations,
              either you or Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those
              Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively
              resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one
              party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
              ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT
              AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and
              conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
              Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate,
              the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
              Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are
              available at the AAA Application www.adr.org. If you are not an
              individual or have used the Company Services on behalf of an
              entity, the AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for
              Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
              determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall
              be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a
              court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your
              share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
              Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
              If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive,
              Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
              arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
              documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision
              in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
              requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
              and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
              Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
              applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Bergen County,
              State of New Jersey, provided that arbitration governed by the AAA
              Consumer Rules will take place, at your option, in your county of
              residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or
              at the county/state location previously specified in this Section,
              or as may otherwise be determined by the arbitrator.&nbsp;Except
              as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may
              litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
              arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on
              the award entered by the arbitrator.

              <strong>Restrictions.</strong>
              You and Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
              Dispute between Company and you individually. To the full extent
              permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any
              other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
              arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
              procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
              to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
              the general public or any other persons.

                Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.
              </strong>
              You and Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject
              to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and
              binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
              protect, or concerning the validity of any of your or
              Company&rsquo;s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute
              related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
              invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for
              injunctive relief. If this Section is found to be illegal or
              unenforceable then neither you nor Company will elect to arbitrate
              any Dispute falling within that portion of this Section found to
              be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
              court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
              jurisdiction above, and you and Company agree to submit to the
              personal jurisdiction of that court.

          Company regarding the use of the Company Services. The failure of
          Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this
