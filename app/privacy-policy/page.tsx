          &ldquo;Non-Personally-Identifying Information&rdquo; is information
          that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
          associated with a specific person. &ldquo;Personally-Identifying
          Information,&rdquo; by contrast, is information such as a name or
          email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a
          specific person. Like most Application operators, Company gathers from
          users of the Application Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the
          sort that applications, depending on their settings, may make
          available. That information includes the user&rsquo;s Internet
          Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type. Although
          such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible
          for Company to determine from an IP address a user&rsquo;s Internet
          service provider and the geographic location of the visitor&rsquo;s
          point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage
          data.&nbsp;Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information
          gathered from users of the Application to help Company better
          understand how the Application is being used. By identifying patterns
          and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Application
          to improve users&rsquo; experiences, both in terms of content and ease
          of use. From time to time, Company may also release the
          Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Application users
          in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the
          usage of the Application.

        <p>
          A &ldquo;Beacon&rdquo; is an object that is embedded in an
          application, web page or email that is usually invisible to the user
          and allows Application operators to check whether a user has viewed a
          particular areas of the application or an email. Company may use
          Beacons on the Application and in emails to count users who have
          visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded
          services. Beacons are not used to access users&rsquo;
          Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Company may
          use to compile aggregated statistics about Application usage. Beacons
          collect only a limited set of information including a Cookie number,
          time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page
          or email on which the Beacon resides. You may not decline Beacons,

          may include each user&rsquo;s name, address, email address, and
          telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial
          information such as your payment method (valid credit card number,
          type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may
          request information about your interests and activities, your gender,
          age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic
          information, and other relevant information as determined by Company

            COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY

        </p>

        <p>
          Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors
          and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information
          received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this
          Privacy Policy, however, with respect to Personally-Identifying
          Information that users provide directly to those third parties or that
          those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties
          include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a
          variety of other third party applications accessible through the
          Application. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party
          Applications and applications accessible through the Application.
          Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or
          gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a
          third-party, or using a third party application, whether by means of a
          link on the Application, directly through the Application, or
          otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information

          that Application or application, and should take those steps necessary
          to, in those users&rsquo; discretion, protect their privacy.

          <strong>SECURITY</strong>
        </p>

          We take security of your Personally-Identifying Information seriously
          and use reasonable electronic, personnel, and physical measures to
          protect it from loss, theft, alteration, or misuse. &nbsp;However,
          please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully
          eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons
          will view your information. We are not responsible for third party
          circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to protect all information on our Application as is
          necessary. However, you are responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality of your Personally-Identifying Information by keeping
          your password confidential. You should change your password
          immediately if you believe someone has gained unauthorized access to

          Application and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
          We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual
          and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to
          do so (such as improving and developing the Application, and enhancing
          its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense
          of legal claims.
        </p>

        <p>
          The retention periods are different depending on different criteria,
          such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the
          information. For example, when we process your information such as
          your profile information to provide you with the Application, we keep
          this information for as long as you have an account. If you violate
          our Terms of Use or other conditions or policies, we may remove your
          profile immediately, but may keep other information about you to
          process the violation.
        </p>
